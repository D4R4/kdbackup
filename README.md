#What is kdbackup bash script

kdbackup bash script was created to cover special case when we need to take a backup from one folder contents and one mysql database contents.

Sometimes may be are running our website in a linux server that did not have any control panel like CPanel also there is no backup software that take a daily or weekly backup and we need to create a backup from our website content (public_html folder for example) and our MySQL database content. in this case you can use kdbackup as alternative simple backup script that can create a daily, schedule or on the fly backup from your website contents.
